Week 6	Mini-projects on digital circuits and digital module design for signal processing algorithms.

Key Technical Concepts
-->VLSI Design Overview:
IC design flow, Y-chart model, ASIC & FPGA design methods.
Verilog HDL Modeling Types:
Dataflow modeling: Uses assign statements and continuous assignments.
Behavioral modeling: Uses procedural blocks like always, initial.
Structural modeling: Gate-level modeling using logic primitives.
Combinational Circuits:
Adders, Subtractors, Encoders, Decoders, MUX/DEMUX with Verilog examples.
Sequential Circuits:
Flip-flops (RS, D-latch, edge-triggered), Counters (asynchronous, Johnson).
VLSI Signal Processing:
FIR filter pipelining, parallelism, reconfigurability, and DSP optimization techniques.
Applications include ADC, wireless communication, CORDIC processors, and speech processing.
